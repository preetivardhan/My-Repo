##For any Linux VM if you don't have root access and whoever have root access has left the org do the following
###This needs admin access to proxmox or Vcenter console

reboot the vm from the vcenter/proxmox console -> hit 'Esc' to load the grub screen while it boots up

Find the line - linux /boot/vmlinuz-... root=UUID=...
At the end of this line append - init=/bin/bash
Boot it by presssing Ctrl+X (or F10)
You will be landed to root shell
Mount the root partition as write - mount -o remount,rw /
Now you can do anything like edit the /etc/grops file or edit the fstab or visudo (/etc/sudoers) file to add user to root access etc.

exec /sbin/init - To boot the instance normally.
