# This explains pain partition in Linux # Other way si to use LVM which is easier

**Consider below example**
Take not of Start and End blocks of each disk.
sda1 ends at 96471039 and sda2 starts at 96473086 (/dev/sda2 and /dev/sda5 (swap) occupy a 4 GB region immediately after /dev/sda1)
Most of the 600 GB is unallocated, but itâ€™s after the swap partition, so you can't extend /dev/sda1 directly.

/dev/sda has been extended to 650GB of size. 

*sudo fdisk -l*
Disk /dev/sda: 650 GiB, 697932185600 bytes, 1363148800 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0xc85de148

Device     Boot    Start       End  Sectors Size Id Type
/dev/sda1  *        2048  96471039 96468992  46G 83 Linux
/dev/sda2       96473086 104855551  8382466   4G  5 Extended
/dev/sda5       96473088 104855551  8382464   4G 82 Linux swap / Solaris

# Now mount /dev/sda to a mount point on the device /mnt #
fdisk /dev/sda
(hit m for available options/help)
n -> for new partiotion (do this in out case as we are creating new partition fron /dev/sda)
Accept all default vaules after this. Like start sector and end sector. 
hit w to write changes to the partition table.

After creating partition, format the new partition.

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda6
